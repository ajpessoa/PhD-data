 Okay, and session starts now.
 Okay, I have to start speaking in English.
 If you don't understand anything that I say, just tell me to repeat it.
 Okay, so the small seaside town of Otari is known for its fresh fish and skilled sailors.
 But above all, it's a big logging town, providing valuable wood to the nearby metropolis of Absalom.
 But for you, Otari is home.
 You grew up playing on the docks, getting lost in the nearby woods,
 and hearing the fantastical stories of travelers from faraway lands, tales of terrifying dragons, and virtuous knights.
 Such adventures have always seemed so distant to you, until today.
 Word has begun to spread around Otari that there's a problem down at the Otari fishery.
 Some are saying that some sort of beast is lurking in the basement, feeding on the stores of salted fish.
 Folks are worried that whatever is eating the fish might get hungry and go out for more.
 You've received a letter from Tamili Tenderville, this person here.
 Sir Halfling.
 The owner of the fishery. Inside is a desperate plea for help.
 With a town guard busy protecting the loggers, she needs a few brave souls to venture down into the basement of her warehouse
 and put an end to the beast that's feasting on her fish.
 Do you have the courage to face the menace under Otari?
 Yes.
 So, before we start, I'd like all of you to take a minute to just look at your character sheets.
 And if we could go like clockwise, you introduce your character and his speciality and what he is in.
 [Silence]
 Do you want to go first? You're the most experienced one here.
 You can go first.
 Don't pass the ball to me.
 Go for it.
 I believe in you.
 Thank you.
 I'm Chiara. I'm a woman, a cleric one.
 And I'm here to heal you all. Helping with my religion and make sure that anyone dies or nobody dies.
 I am the cleric.
 Okay.
 Martin, do you want to go?
 Not yet.
 No?
 Yeah?
 Okay. So, I will make a strong representation.
 So, my guide's called... Sorry, I'm Balwaleish.
 From Bavaria. Son of Valdemario.
 And I'm actually a farm hand. So, I'm like a fighter. Okay?
 I can protect you all. I can actually have my strength to help you all.
 And also my farming skills and a little of war. Just a few about farming. And that's it.
 Martin, use your quill to make that.
 Okay.
 I'm Ezrin. I am a scholar. And I have studied for a long, long time.
 And I can help with any lore that you need.
 And I can also cast spells if the timing is right.
 Sure.
 You, as a wizard, you should have like a spell list on your character sheet in the back.
 Right?
 So...
 So, wait.
 I found it more correctly.
 So, yes, we have these cantrips. So, this means that all of these spells, there's no limitation.
 So, you can cast them whenever you want. Okay?
 And these ones...
 I'll explain what these symbols mean afterwards.
 But this means you can also cast these spells here that does this type of magic.
 This means that it's a spell that you can cast from far away.
 This means that you have to actually touch the person in order to cast the spell.
 When it says "you can touch." Okay?
 So, that's basically the difference.
 So, that is your special abilities is the fact that you can cast spells. And also the priests.
 Yeah. I can heal you.
 Spells!
 Exactly. And also buffs, I guess.
 Something buffs.
 But normally I can detect magic.
 No sand traps, maybe.
 Possible.
 Make light to get some adventures in dark spaces.
 And heal.
 What about you?
 So, I'm Marizio.
 I'm a rogue girl.
 So, I have very good vision.
 And very good hearing.
 So, I may be very useful in this adventure.
 And I can tell much more.
 So, you are... just to explain. You are a rogue.
 Yeah.
 Meaning that you're kind of a thief.
 And sneaky.
 Yeah. I'm a criminal.
 Meaning that you also like to attack from behind the enemies.
 So, your idea in combat is to try to flank or go behind enemies and then backstab them.
 Okay.
 And you're also, because you're a rogue, you're very good at detecting traps.
 And detecting potential danger in the environment.
 So, ideally, when you're looking at the environment, you're the one who should take priority.
 Okay.
 While Valeros here is the person that, if there's enemies, he should be on the front line to take the damage.
 Because he has way more armor.
 Okay.
 While the spellcaster has not a lot of armor, so she should stay behind.
 And the priest is kind of a middle ground.
 Has armor, can attack, but also is like a spellcaster.
 So, more like a hybrid kind of class.
 Right.
 A mixture between spellcaster and warrior.
 Just so you all know kind of the archetypes of the characters.
 Okay.
 So, you arrive at the fishery.
 At the Tenderveil fishery.
 I don't remember correctly.
 And...
 Tamali.
 Yes.
 Redirects you to the basement.
 So, I will ask you to take each of your tokens and place them on the stairs here.
 In a specific order.
 So, define the order that you want to go down the stairs.
 The first guy should be me.
 Because I'm like tanking the things.
 Yeah.
 So...
 You go first.
 Yeah.
 You can go up until the stairs.
 Yes.
 Go here.
 Yes.
 Then it should be...
 Me probably.
 You or her.
 Yeah.
 And the last one is you.
 Because you are the...
 Very fragile.
 I can stay in the last.
 But you have the atomic bomb, you know.
 I have one other idea.
 I can stay at last.
 So, in the stairs someone trip or make a cut.
 I'll...
 I see and I heal automatically.
 And I have...
 I see my armor is...
 I think is good for something behind trying to attack us.
 Okay, okay, okay.
 Okay, so...
 You want me to put me in the top of the stair.
 Okay.
 Then I go second.
 Yeah.
 Behind you.
 Yeah.
 It will...
 Yeah.
 It stands randomly.
 Could you just...
 You will be in the middle.
 Stay in front of me.
 Yeah.
 With her.
 I will heal you if you need it.
 I'm gonna use...
 I'm gonna use it as a shield.
 Okay, so the way this is going to work.
 So, during outside of combat the way it's going to work is...
 You're going to take turns to move each of our tokens and you tell me basically where
 you want to go with some reservations because things might happen and I will let you know
 if you can go that way or not before something triggers or something happens.
 Okay?
 Keep in mind that you can always use your abilities at all times when you're out of
 combat.
 So, for example, you can have abilities such as perception, like you can roll with perception
 to see if you find anything that's interesting in the environment.
 You can roll your athletics or acrobatics to make a jump somewhere that's...
 For example, if there's a gap you can use your other skills.
 So, always consider to use your skills and your character's strengths to your full advantage
 when exploring the environment.
 Okay?
 So, continuing the adventure.
 The stairs leading to the basement of the Otari Fishery creak with age as you make yourself
 the stairs to find the beast that has been eating all the fish.
 In the center of the room between stone pillars holding up the fishery overhead are barrels
 filled with salted fish.
 The smell kind of permeates throughout this room.
 Two of these barrels have been smashed open, spilling their contents on the floor.
 In the east wall is a large hole opening into the darkness.
 Just a few hours ago, you gathered with a few other adventurers in the office of Tamale
 Tunderval's office, where she offered you ten gold pieces each if you could put an end
 to this mess.
 She was thrilled when you agreed to help her with this simple task, but as you make your
 way downstairs, you can't help but wonder if this might be more, or a lot more, adventure
 than you bargained for.
 So, your turn.
 The environment is open.
 What do you do?
 I will cry over the dead fish.
 Just being the top of the cell, knowing that somebody wants to eat them, not the beast.
 When making movement, it's like five, or it's 25?
 So, each square means five feet.
 So, if you look at your character sheet, there is a section there that says how much movement
 that you can do.
 It's either 25 feet or 30 feet.
 That means that for each square, like each square is five feet, you just do the calculation.
 So, usually it's four squares or five squares that you can move in combat.
 Okay?
 It should be around here.
 So, speed.
 So, it's the suit where it says speed.
 That means the amount that your character can traverse in one turn.
 Okay?
 We're like fellows.
 We arrived and it smells like shit.
 Okay, it's really smelly, but what do you want to do right now?
 You want to go for that place and they will like point out for the opening or do you want
 to explore this room?
 And I will just go a little in, just to open and try to see if anything.
 Roll me a perception.
 Oh, but then, perception, it's a roll 20.
 Somebody is dying right now.
 Yes, roll 20.
 Yeah.
 So, as you like you, it's two plus k?
 It's two plus...
 Your perception should be like the biggest stats.
 I think it's...
 Acrobatics is usually like it's here.
 It's here in the H.
 Oh, okay.
 It's plus five.
 Plus five?
 So, how much do I need?
 Seven.
 Okay.
 So...
 Lucky number.
 Eh, eh.
 Okay, so you squint, like trying to see if you can make any sense of the darkness, but
 it's only void.
 Nothing.
 It's safe.
 You can come.
 Okay.
 That was the last phrase I hear of my mom.
 She's a very sad priest now.
 I'm very happy.
 All right.
 So, guys, what do you do?
 Next.
 I have two colleagues in front of me, but I will try help my fighter over the stairs.
 You can move your character.
 Even though I will just say, "Yeah, go, go."
 In front of me.
 I mean, they can let you through.
 It's fine.
 Do you like me to?
 Yeah, you can.
 I go to your side, my fighter.
 I will be here because I have 25 of feet.
 You can be here, actually.
 Okay.
 And I will try to get my shield.
 Not raising it, but use it to cast light on them.
 You cast light?
 My cantrip light.
 Touch an object to make it glow with a bright light in a 20-foot radius until either cast
 light again or prepare your spells.
 Okay.
 So, you cast light on your shield.
 The environment kind of glows.
 You go like, "Oh, that's a little bit..."
 The light kind of shines right through your face.
 Roll me perception.
 So...
 27.
 Natural 20 in the first roll.
 Okay.
 Natural 20.
 So, as you kind of focus your eyes on the darkness, you start to see like two red beady
 eyes kind of looking back at you and like shifting around.
 And as you pay attention at the sound, you start to hear like...
 [makes mouth sounds]
 Cel's, I think I saw a mouse.
 Do you see it?
 Let me see.
 Why?
 I don't know how to turn this off.
 This is a problem, bro.
 You are killing me.
 You can tell that what you see in the darkness still hasn't caught your attention.
 Okay.
 You can sneak it.
 You don't see me.
 I'm blinding, too.
 He's blind?
 He's a blind mouse?
 You care about the mouse.
 Where is the mouse?
 It's in front or in the other...
 Where is that mouse?
 It's in the...
 So, this here...
 So, basically, this entire area now is bright.
 And here is all the darkness that you see through here.
 So, all of this is dark.
 And the eyes are kind of peering for you.
 Do you see the scary stairs over there that smell death?
 It's over here.
 Over there, sorry.
 Yeah, sure.
 You guys miss something.
 Wait a second.
 We need our friends.
 All right.
 So, as you move forward, the eyes...
 You don't see anything.
 You see the eyes, like, shift towards Valeros.
 Valeros, stop.
 And the focus.
 And you start to see, like, you start to hear, like...
 And you also start to hear that.
 And you kind of look around.
 And you see...
 Now it's clear to both of you.
 Like, two giant rats.
 Actually, four giant rats.
 Bullshit.
 It's not a mouse, but it's a big fat rat the size of a dog coming, peering out
 through the darkness.
 And now I need you all to roll for initiative.
 So...
 You're not even thinking about the stairs.
 All right.
 So, what this means is that combat...
 We start combat.
 Okay?
 So, the beginning of combat, or the way that combat works, is turnbets.
 So, all of us are going to roll this d20.
 And we'll add our perception.
 So, the perception is this skill here.
 Next to our hit points.
 Like, right next to the hit points.
 Okay?
 So, you roll a d20, and you add that perception.
 That will determine your order in the turn order.
 Okay.
 So, I'm going to roll for the rats.
 Oh, that is scary.
 That's a quickie lizard.
 Yeah, it's a quickie.
 So, the mouse is a friendly one?
 Yeah.
 They're lovely.
 It has a door.
 Beautiful.
 Guys, we found the problem.
 So, who rolled between 20 and 15?
 Or more than 20?
 With perception, I got 21.
 21?
 Okay.
 So...
 Ezran.
 Then...
 Rat1.
 Who rolled between 20 and 15?
 I rolled 17.
 No, 17?
 Chiara, right?
 Chiara.
 Yeah.
 Chiara...
 Rats.
 2.
 Who rolled between 15 and 10?
 15.
 15?
 Okay.
 Also 10?
 14.
 14?
 Valeros and...
 Miserio?
 Yeah.
 Miserio.
 Valeros.
 And then it's the rats.
 So, 3.
 10.
 Rat.
 Okay.
 So, the way it works.
 This game allows you to do three actions.
 Okay?
 And...
 If you look at your instructions.
 Okay?
 You can see here.
 This is actions.
 If you see, for example...
 A symbol.
 Alright?
 So, for example, for Ezran here, he can cast spells.
 Meaning that he can cast Magic Missile as one action, two actions, or three actions.
 Okay?
 That means that in order for him to cast a spell, he needs to waste three actions.
 Okay?
 Movement takes one action.
 Right?
 What's movement?
 Wait a minute.
 Movement is one action.
 And you can go 25 feet.
 In your case.
 So, stride.
 You can use stride.
 Okay?
 Oh, yeah.
 This is easier.
 You can see all of the actions that you can take in one turn.
 Okay?
 So...
 My action is prone.
 Prone.
 What does prone mean?
 It means that you're lying on the ground.
 You can just fall to the ground.
 That's one action.
 You can interact with an object.
 That takes one action.
 And you can interact with the object.
 That takes one action.
 Leap means that you jump.
 Right?
 So, jumping from one point to another.
 That also takes one action.
 Seek.
 Like, scanning the environment for potential traps or things that you can use.
 That's one action.
 Standing back up.
 So, if you fall to the ground and you want to stand back up.
 That is one action.
 If you want to move only five feet.
 And this is more related to combat because some enemies might react if you get close to them.
 Or if you move away from them.
 You can avoid that reaction by using just the step.
 Okay?
 Stride means that you move.
 You use your full speed to move.
 And stride means you do one attack.
 Okay?
 That's basically the actions that you can do.
 Alright?
 So, Edwin, because you're first.
 You can use your actions.
 You can do your turn.
 What do you want to do?
 So, first I'm going to use stride.
 Okay.
 So, I can move 25 feet.
 So, each square is five feet.
 Yes.
 Good.
 So, you still have two actions that you can use.
 And maybe if you want I can cast a spell to try to get rid of the rats.
 Sure.
 What spell do you cast?
 Fireball.
 So, since I still have two actions left.
 Yeah.
 I am going to cast two magic missile.
 Okay.
 So, how does that work?
 Just so I remember.
 Magic missile.
 For every action you spend to cast a spell you should adopt a magical force-sworded
 creature you can see within 120 feet.
 Okay.
 So, you cast two.
 What's the dice?
 It says here the damage is...
 Now, that should say like 2D something or what?
 1D4 plus 1.
 Okay.
 So, for each magic missile you roll one of these.
 When it says 1D it means one dice of four faces.
 Or if it's 1D6 it means one dice of six faces.
 If it says 2D6 for example it means two dice of six faces.
 Okay.
 Just so you know the language.
 So, in this case, because you have two actions you can cast two magic missiles.
 You can roll two of these dice and then you add plus one to each.
 So, how much damage does it do?
 And which rat are you targeting by the way?
 For one missile I am targeting this rat.
 For the other I am targeting this one.
 So, you are targeting one missile for each rat.
 Okay.
 How much damage does the first missile do?
 It's four plus one.
 It's this one.
 It's like four.
 Okay.
 So, one of them did four plus one.
 Okay.
 And that one is the top one.
 So, five damage, right?
 And the other one did three damage.
 Three damage.
 So, as you cast you both see like what appears to be like small fragments of light coming out from its fingertips as it moves towards the rat.
 And you see like little beads of magic just smacking on each of the rats as they kind of chitter as the magic kind of focuses on them.
 So, the second rat, actually one of the rats is one of the other turn now.
 You don't need to move this way.
 So, it uses one action to target Valeros.
 And will attack, so it will try to bite you for 22.
 Oh wait, it goes in.
 So, how this works.
 The rat rolled an attack to see if it's going to hit him.
 So, you all have what we call an armor class which is AC.
 Oh, but I cannot really raise my shield.
 But only on your turn, right?
 It's not a reaction, it's an action.
 Oh, it's an action.
 It's an action.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
 No, no, it's been your reaction to block a physical attack.
 Oh, you can, okay.
 But it's the shield, okay, but it's the damage.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Shields work, okay.
 So, basically what this means is that it's going to do a check to see if it hits you or it bypasses your armor.
 So, this symbolizes your skill to avoid damage and protect it with your armor.
 In this case, I rolled higher than what is here, meaning that he's going to take damage now.
 So, now I'm going to roll for damage which in your case is represented here if you do a weapon attack.
 So, here is like a 1D, in your case it's a 1D4.
 In another case it's like a 1D something else.
 And then you add your strength to the attack, if I'm not mistaken.
 Something like that.
 So, he's going to do damage on you.
 That is 2 points of damage to HP.
 So, if I actually use the shield walk, I can actually reduce the amount of damage by 5.
 Okay, so basically you don't feel anything because your armor is able to absorb the damage.
 Okay, he's going to attack once more time.
 So, the second attack, he gets a penalty.
 So, as you do more attacks...
 -5 and then -10. So for the second attack, because he's doing a second attack, he gets a -5 on his roll.
 So he's going to... so -5, that is 12 to hit, so I guess he misses, right?
 He misses, so...
 So that's his turn.
 That's good.
 Okay.
 And now it's Kiara.
 Oh, I saw the move of the rat, so first I will stride, but I will not use my 20 feet, I guess.
 I will put side by side by Valerios, like over here.
 10, 50.
 This is one of my actions.
 The other one will be... I will strike that rat that tried to bite my friend with my scimitar.
 Do a roll attack.
 17 plus 4, 21.
 21 that hits.
 Okay.
 So I will ride the 6 plus 1.
 6 plus 1, 7.
 Alright, so you go to the rat and you just easily slice off its head and the thing just dies.
 Gross.
 You're covered with rat blood.
 Okay, my last action will be raise a shield.
 Now my bright shield, my light shield is raised.
 Yes.
 And I will end my turn with some disgusting blood on myself.
 Okay.
 It's the second rat's turn.
 He's going to also move upwards as it moves towards Valerios.
 Also going to attack you.
 That is 25 to hit.
 Oh, yeah.
 Hits.
 That is 3 points of damage.
 Okay.
 With me just 21.
 Yeah.
 He's going to do a second attack with a penalty.
 That is 15 to hit.
 Misses.
 Misses.
 That's his turn.
 Now it is Valerios.
 You goddamn beast.
 I will slay you down.
 What's happening? I have blood on my hands.
 I will start by my first will be an attack.
 Yes.
 So it's 9 plus 9, 18.
 That hits.
 And it's a D6.
 D6.
 No, D8.
 Sorry.
 I don't have a D8.
 You don't have a D8?
 No, no.
 You have a D12.
 You have a D8?
 No, I don't.
 No, we don't.
 Okay.
 So it's a D8 plus 4 and it's 17.
 17?
 It's a 7.
 7.
 Sorry.
 I was excited.
 So yeah.
 So as the rat bites you, you just with your other hand, you just slice it and its head
 detaches from its body.
 Also, it's dead.
 More blood.
 Now, I want to make a question.
 It's like if I actually go there and block, if the rat flees the combat, can I attack
 him or something like that?
 Do you have an attack reaction?
 No, no, I don't.
 Actually, I don't think so.
 I don't think so.
 I have attack opportunity.
 Oh yeah.
 Okay.
 So that means that you do.
 So if you go close and it tries to leave your radius, you get a free attack on it.
 Okay.
 So what I will try to do is actually to use my second action to use stride.
 Yeah.
 And I will try to block I think here.
 Yes.
 Because there, yeah, I can't.
 Yes.
 And can I use my last one to make another attack?
 Yes.
 Well, with a -5 penalty, unless it's an agile weapon, I guess it's not an agile.
 It's not an agile.
 It's a...
 And probably it misses because it's 9 plus 2.
 Plus 2, yeah.
 It's 11.
 No, that misses.
 So you try to hit it, but the racket is too shifty and you can't hit it.
 Marizia, it's your turn.
 Okay.
 So as I'm still in the stairs, I'll just jump.
 And as I have this in the speed 30 feet, I'll go 3 how it is.
 You can move further away if you want because every square is 5 feet.
 So if you have 30, you can move technically 6.
 Okay.
 So you're very speedy.
 I just want to make an impression just jumping from the stairs.
 Okay.
 And then...
 I think you can also, you also probably have a bow, I guess.
 You have a bow and you have daggers.
 So, you know, here.
 So here, you have all of your weapons.
 So when it's called a melee weapon, it means you have to be right next to it.
 But you also have a ranged weapon, meaning, oh, it's a daggers.
 So you can just throw your daggers as well.
 Oh, okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 If you want to do that.
 Then I want to do that.
 So it's the 1d4.
 No, you roll this d20 first.
 And you see that big orange number that's there?
 Yes.
 So you add that to your roll.
 Okay.
 13, it's 7, it's 20.
 Yeah, you easily hit it.
 So now you roll the 1d4.
 Yes.
 The d4 is the pyramid.
 And you add the bow.
 Okay.
 4.
 Oh, okay.
 Top one.
 4, so 5.
 So 5.
 Okay.
 So you kind of skillfully, you throw the dagger.
 Boom, it hits.
 It hits the rat right in the face for 5 points of damage.
 You still have one more action.
 You can still do one more thing.
 So can I do another?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 But you have to, now you have a penalty of minus 5.
 And that applies, oh, okay, here.
 Yeah, when you attack again.
 Okay.
 Then I will just try again.
 Okay, go ahead.
 Okay.
 12, so that means 7 minus 5.
 Minus 5, so that's plus 2.
 Okay.
 14.
 14, ooh.
 You hit, but barely like, goes right above.
 Okay.
 As the previous dagger kind of made it twitch around,
 and its movement is to the right, and you miss it barely.
 Okay.
 It is a rat zoo.
 3.
 That was amazing.
 Thank you.
 So this will go here, and we'll attack Valeros.
 Oh.
 Because the rats are really just reactive beasts.
 That is 15 to hit.
 It misses.
 It misses.
 So it goes and bites, but because it has a dagger stuck to its face,
 it's having quite difficulty doing that.
 Next one is, oh, even less, so it also misses.
 Okay.
 So this one also fails.
 Can you move the rat closer to Valeros as well?
 We'll also try the tarot.
 This rolled a 2, so now it's going to miss the first roll.
 This one is much better.
 Minus 5.
 19.
 Oh, yeah.
 It hits.
 It hits, yeah.
 4.
 6 points of damage.
 I will use my reaction to get 0.
 You absorb like 5 damage, don't you?
 Yeah.
 You get 1 damage.
 For 5, I get 1.
 Yeah, because it absorbs 5, but you still get 1 damage.
 But I have a question.
 Yes.
 It's like my shield has 20 hit points.
 Ah, yeah, you should remove those hit points from your shield.
 Now you win.
 And he's now decreasing.
 Yes, because it starts to break.
 So before it was actually 3.
 Yes, and now 5, so 8 total.
 8, okay.
 Not that.
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
 In the paper.
 What we actually had here.
 8.
 And here I lose 1.
 Because eventually your shield can break.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 All right.
 That is the first round.
 We go to the second round with Ezran.
 Starts again.
 I am going to use my crossbow to hit one of the mice.
 Okay.
 Attack.
 So you roll a d20 plus the number.
 So it's this plus perception, right?
 No, no, it's that plus your crossbow attack.
 Oh.
 Plus 5, I guess is that what I mean?
 Yes.
 8.
 No, that doesn't hit.
 So you aim with the crossbow.
 It doesn't hit.
 The crossbow takes 1 action to reload.
 If I'm not mistaken.
 So you reload the crossbow.
 You can use it again.
 I mean if you want to reload it.
 So I will reload and try to hit the mouse again.
 Okay.
 So you do that.
 But you get a plus 5 penalty.
 Meaning that you just roll a d20 in this case.
 Let's see what happens.
 That's a natural 1.
 So you point, but the thing jams and nothing comes out.
 That's your turn.
 Is everything alright?
 Kiara.
 Oh god, it's me again.
 I still have the shield raiden.
 Okay.
 And if I use a spell after I lose it for the rest of the day or I can have like infinity
 spells.
 To be honest, it's been a long time since I played this.
 But because it's the first session, yeah, you can use spells.
 Okay.
 If I can use spell first, I will go to Valerius and touch it.
 And I will use heal.
 Use only 1 action of mine.
 Okay.
 And I will roll 1d8.
 But you need to move to him, right?
 Right.
 1 action is to move to.
 So you move to Valerius.
 Yeah.
 You put his hand on his shoulder.
 And I will heal you for a d8 that I don't have it.
 Thank you.
 You get 8 points.
 You heal 8 points.
 I heal 4.
 So you get back to full health.
 Yes.
 After that, because I have 1 action and my seal is razor, I will try to use my scimitar
 against that rat.
 Okay.
 That's my friend.
 He's a 1.
 So he's 5.
 You completely miss the rat.
 Valerius, your turn.
 Because you're covering his face.
 Where is it?
 It's there.
 He will try to hit.
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
 He will try to hit the first big mouse.
 And I just go.
 It's 16 + 9.
 It's 20.
 Okay.
 So, let's see.
 It's 8.
 8 points for that one.
 Yeah, I mean, you make it into chop suey.
 What is this?
 Oh yeah!
 The rat completely blows up.
 Jesus!
 It's everywhere.
 In this position, can I hit the other rat?
 Yes, you can.
 So I will try to use my second action to attack the other one, which is 12 + 5.
 It's 7 + 9.
 It's...
 7.9.
 Minus 5, right?
 No, 7.
 I was including.
 Ah, 12, okay.
 26, yeah.
 26, no, 16.
 16.
 Yes.
 That does hit.
 So, let's try.
 Again, it's 4 + 4.
 It's 8.
 8, alright.
 So in a swift motion, as you kill the other rat, you're able to with the other sword,
 and you cut the other rat in half, and they're all dead.
 End of combat.
 You just exterminated some rats.
 Congratulations.
 I feel powerful.
 So as you stand in the room, the room is now painted in rat blood, but as you breathe,
 you don't see any danger.
 What am I going to do now?
 Hey, hold, man.
 Was this the enemy we were supposed to kill?
 It's dead.
 I can go and say it's all fine and dandy.
 This was done by an ordinary rat.
 This was something bigger.
 Okay.
 This was a big rat, like a dog-sized rat we're talking about, right?
 Yeah, it's a pretty big rat.
 Four of them almost killed me.
 And my shield.
 Ah, shield, right.
 I will cast light again on my shield.
 So you cast light, and you see the corridor.
 Close your eyes.
 You see the light shining on the corridor and into what appears to be an opening at the end.
 If I'm not mistaken, the one that actually has the best perception here is our rogue.
 So can you just look and see if you see anything there?
 Just like if there are more of those things.
 So how can I do that?
 Just walk into the danger.
 Just look to the danger, if there's any danger, if you can actually perceive something.
 I will go on your back.
 Okay, so I have one thing here that says you have a +2 circumstance bonus to perception to hear creatures within 30 feet.
 So that means that if you start to hear noises or if you want to check to see if you hear anything,
 you get a bonus of +2 in addition to the perception that you already have.
 So in total, I guess, because you have how many perception for?
 Seven, so it's even a +2 on those seven, so nine.
 Okay.
 If you want to listen to creatures or things like that in the darkness.
 Okay, so I'll use this.
 So roll me a d20 plus that bonus.
 So 19.
 Okay, and I assume that you go closer to the...
 And I can move the houses however I want?
 Not however you want, but you can move until I say...
 Okay.
 I cannot tell you if you want to.
 Oh, God damn it.
 She's running.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 Because what you see, I mean, unless you want to go into the darkness,
 but what you see in the lights is up to here, okay?
 Okay.
 So if you move here, so that if you move there, you don't hear anything.
 But your keen eyes immediately see that there is a big fall.
 Okay.
 So you're moving and you see that there's about 10 feet tall until you see the floor.
 Okay, so jumping this is probably doable for you because you're quite nimble.
 But as you look behind, you see a large man with a lot of armor
 and probably it would be more harder for him to jump this.
 Okay.
 So, but I can call them and tell them to come near me.
 Yes, you can say that it's safe.
 It's safe so you can go near me.
 Azzy, will you come with us if I can call you Azzy?
 Of course.
 Nice.
 All right, so you guys follow?
 Yeah.
 I will walk.
 You walk there?
 Yes.
 With my right shield.
 Around something like this, right?
 It will be like, oh, damn, I can help like the old guy like to, I will like give you a hand
 and they also probably go down there and help the old guy.
 What do you do exactly?
 So you like grabbing by the hand and you just pitch him over the...
 Can actually, can we actually find any stone, anything that we can use a rope to actually use the rope?
 Yeah, definitely.
 You should have, everybody should have an inventory also.
 Most likely you have rope and all that kind of stuff, so yes.
 You can easily find a perch for tying your rope.
 Do you do that?
 Yeah.
 Okay, so you tie a rope around the perch.
 It feels quite safe and you pitch it over the edge.
 And you hear the rope going down, but the rope is longer than the amount of...
 But we have an old guy, so we need this.
 So first ladies, you may go.
 Okay.
 And then the old guy and I will be the last one.
 So for...
 I think so.
 Climb down the rope, just do me an athletics or an acrobatics check.
 Can I actually help them when they are trying?
 Yes.
 And give some kind of support or...
 Yes, you can aid them and it gives a plus two if I'm mistaken.
 I will choose the acrobatics.
 Okay.
 So roll me a d20 plus your acrobatics.
 11.
 11, yeah.
 So you easily go down, no problem.
 And you on the lower floors as you look around, you start to see what appears to be like white
 eggshells kind of all scattered around to the floor as your feet kind of crack around
 stepping on them.
 You guys, you easily see Marizio kind of sliding down and she like waves back up.
 Okay.
 If I go down, I will take the light with me because my shield is lightened.
 So I will leave you a torch or you have a torch yourself.
 We can actually probably see it's just 10 feet.
 So if you are down, you'll probably see.
 Yeah.
 That is enough to actually see the thing, right?
 Thank you for seeing that.
 So also roll me an acrobatics.
 First, I will pray to my god, Syrian, because I'm totally afraid of that stuff.
 And then I will use athletics.
 That is the same like acrobatics and have a natural one.
 Oh, yeah.
 With plus one, two.
 So I will die.
 All right.
 So as you and you got afraid.
 It's on character.
 So as you go grab the rope and start to climb down, your foot slips to the edge.
 And because you are still not prepared to mentally climb down, your hand slipped and you fall back on the back on the floor, taking five points of damage from the fall.
 You literally see like a mask.
 I'm going.
 I'm sorry.
 It's all my fault.
 It's a right.
 And you guys just see the light kind of.
 I was a falling star.
 I will stay on the ground like this.
 What do you do?
 Well, I can go down the rope using my acrobatics.
 All right.
 Ten.
 Ten.
 Yeah.
 So you also after looking at Kiara falling, you're extra careful, but you easily get down even with your old leery bones.
 You're still able to reach the bottom floor without any problems.
 This old man still got it.
 He will use athletics.
 And let's go.
 Oh, it's a huge number.
 It's 17 plus seven.
 So it's twenty twenty four.
 Yeah. Twenty four.
 Twenty four.
 Yeah. All right.
 So you grab the rope, make it look extra easy.
 Like this.
 And you just fall even when you're in huge armor, your physical strength is nothing compared to this problem.
 So you reach the bottom.
 So all of you can just place everybody on the other side.
 Just the formation.
 And you kind of see exactly what Marisi will see.
 So there's the egg shells kind of cracking.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Everybody here.
 Here the chambers are completely pitch black, if not for just the light from the clerics.
 Kiara's light is the only thing separating you from total darkness.
 Miss Kendall, don't you want to go in the front with me because we need to see.
 I'm happy.
 I will use Elon myself.
 Go ahead.
 One deal.
 Can I use a second level spell?
 So it's a V8 plus.
 So I will use two action.
 Sure, because you're out of combat so you can take over time.
 So I will use that and I will…
 This is the second one.
 So it's a target we will win.
 We will take one deal but they get…
 The number of action you take changes the spell.
 D8 plus 8.
 16.
 Yeah, you go back to full health.
 I'm good to healing.
 I'm not good in anything else.
 Yes, Miss Kendall will go with you.
 Right.
 But I can make you the candle too.
 If you prefer you can make me the candle.
 Okay, I will recast light on your armor.
 Okay.
 You are a candle man.
 Do I have any disadvantage when I'm fighting?
 No, but then we will probably see you from afar.
 Because I'm all white. I don't know if I have any disadvantage.
 Disadvantage?
 Not that you're aware of.
 Okay.
 I'm not the very intelligent woman.
 Now you are the candle.
 The thing is I used to play as a draw in D&D.
 So yeah.
 That's the…
 Yeah, okay.
 You are the candle my friend.
 Okay, so now Valerius is a shining beacon in this darkness.
 Hey, health.
 Do you see now something there?
 It's like I don't have your eyes so I can't see anything.
 Okay, so then I want to use my perception.
 Yes.
 With my whisper health.
 Okay.
 If you want to have a good look at the environment you should probably sneak in before then.
 Okay.
 You can just roll me a stealth.
 So you should have a skill which is stealth I think.
 Stealth.
 Stealth.
 Oh, yes.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 You can roll a stealth.
 But it's the…
 Yes.
 Okay, 18 plus 17.
 Okay.
 Yeah, it counts in English.
 So you…
 I just don't calculate.
 Where do you want to…
 So as you go inside, so you can go up into the entrance there.
 Here?
 Yes, exactly.
 Okay.
 As you go inside you immediately like the floor is kind of sticky.
 Okay.
 And as you like kind of put your foot on the ground.
 and it's super sticky. As you look around you see what appears to be this
 shimmering light or this shimmering like goo kind of all around the ceiling
 kind of tangling itself together throughout the entire room. You kind of
 think you've seen this before but in a much smaller scale with spiders. So you
 think this is probably webs. As you look around so you should do me a
 perception now. 19 plus 7 is 26. You see kind of like patches of glowing
 blue fungus kind of clinging to the ceiling and it kind of actually
 provides this very kind of soft glow from the ceiling. You can barely make out
 the various you know strands of webbing that kind of envelops the entire room
 and this is like a really big cavern as you see like this stalagmites kind of
 protruding from the ceiling also. You do see like your you kind of sense that
 there's something kind of moving around but you can't really pinpoint exactly
 where it is. So maybe I need more light. So you are the man of light. No I'm a woman. He is a man. You are the woman of light. No no he is the beacon right now.
 Right now I'm like a huge candle. Okay so maybe since it's safe until here you
 can move here and maybe we can see better. I will just do something. I will move in
 in front of you and the other guys will come with us. So I will just
 come here for you to have. I'll catch your back. Yeah and I will like try to
 light everything but with my shield also. Okay. In the sense that you wouldn't say anything good.
 Okay. So where do you flash the light? Everywhere I light superman. But with my shield.
 So you I mean you get a much clearer view of the room so here you can directly see
 there's like tons of webs and you're kind of moving the light around. And Romeo
 perception. It's a 20. It's a natural 20 plus 5. It's 25. So as you shine the light
 you see as you're like looking around there's one specific section that you
 see where appears to be like a black mass kind of sticking on the ceiling. And as
 you're like focusing on the object you see like there's one two three four five
 six seven eight legs and moving around and shifting up in the ceiling. It still
 hasn't seen you but it looks like a very very large spider. I actually try to step
 back and back and back and I try to the other guys to understand that I'm back and back and back.
 What is happening? I'm like trying to push you all back and back and I will be like
 Yes, man. There's a spider in the ceiling. Like a big one. Like you remember the rats? Like dogs? That kind of shit. It's huge. So it's probably not a great idea to be a beacon man right now? Yeah. Shut me down please. No. But also. Shiny. Old man. Can you make fire? Why?
 The kind of magic that goes kaboom.
 Well. I can try. But maybe we should sleep. So you want to see like spiders? No. It's probably the thing we need to kill. Spiders are cool. I know that flies because of them.
 Well. We can go there. But I don't know if it's a good idea. I will shut you down. I will kill everything there. But first. There's a spider for God's sake. If I shut you down you lose out the right.
 I have a question. In the surprise attack. I don't really know the translation. So I'm not understanding what's heaven. So the creatures that haven't attacked yet are flat, fluted.
 That means that you get a much bigger bonus to your attack. But it means that because you catch them by surprise they are completely unaware. And you are able to make almost as if it's a free attack on them.
 For a lot of them. I'm not sure if you get the immediate critical hit or something. But yeah. That means that you have a super huge bonus on your attack. It's the same as if you catch somebody that's sleeping.
 That's completely unaware. I mean obviously if you go there with a knife and just stick it in his face. You get a super big bonus on damage. That's basically what it means. Being flat-floated means that he has no idea that you are there.
 Okay. So can I do that?
 For sure. But you will start combat.
 What do you think about this?
 I'm not against it. But I will shut down your light. But first, before shutting you down in the light state. I will give a torch to each other to have fire here.
 Where's her? Because she wants to be in local fire.
 Yeah. So the spider won't see me.
 Can you actually see in the dark?
 I can see in low light.
 I will keep my torch out.
 No, but low light means that there are lights coming from the ceiling so you can actually see. But there has to be at least a little bit of source of light. It's kind of like a cat. There has to be a little source to be able to see. It's completely bit of a blackout.
 Everyone has a torch. And if you want to burn it, the thing down.
 So, we wrench the end of our time, officially.
